        		<p>The impact of UCI has been immense since its inception. A community once overshadowed
				by Vodou and dominated by fear and hatred, is now a community working together as a 
				result of the Gospel. God has used UCI to empower Haitians and help 9 villages surrounding 
				Caiman with church planting, irrigation, agriculture, high quality
        		education, clean water, sanitation, feeding malnourished children, and constructing houses
        		for the people.

					<h2>Nutrition Center</h2>
					<p>One of the first very visible needs around the Caiman area was combating malnourishment.  In order to do
					 this in an efficient way, feeding centers were begun where kids and families are able to come and receive 
					 a meal during the week.</p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#care">More Info</button>
					<div id="care" class="collapse">
						<p>These centers have also provided opportunities to teach the parents to plant 
					 their own gardens and receive female goats in order to have an opportunity to make an economic investment.</p>
					<p>Merely handing out food has provided opportunities to share the gospel and to talk about how God’s word 
					is much greater than the basic necessities that we think that we need here on earth.</p>

					<h2>Clinic</h2>
					<p>For those that come to the clinic in Caiman, there is a benevolent fund for the ones that are not able 
					to pay anything.  This gives a lot of university students the opportunity to obtain training and experience
					 to become better doctors, which in turn gives medical care for the whole community.</p>

						<p>Touch of Hope’s clinic is located at Tytoo Gardens and is open 3 days a week and sees an average of 
						25 patients a day for a nominal fee.  They provide most of the medications and treat local emergencies.
						  There is also a benevolent fund for surgeries and hospital stays.</p>

					<h2>Education</h2>
					<p>At both UCI and Touch of Hope there is an elementary school which are host to 660 and over 1,000 
					students respectively.  Currently, about half of the children in Haiti do not have the opportunity to 
					complete a primary education.</p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#classroom">More Info</button>
					<div id="classroom" class="collapse">   
						<p> Touch of Hope believes every child in their community should be able to attend school and therefore
						 charges a nominal fee (if the parents can afford it).  Breakfast and lunch are provided daily and for 
						 some it may be the only meal they get that day.   At UCI, the parents are encouraged to work once a 
						 month at the school to help pay back and invest in their child’s education.  The University at UCI is 
						 host to one of the leading medical programs in the country along with seminary students, agriculture, 
						 business, etc.   On all levels of schooling there is a scholarship program that allows students the 
						 opportunity to go to school.</p>
						<p>All university scholarship recipients have work study, behavioral, and academic requirements.  There
						 is a science lab, computer lab, and internet in all the classrooms, dissection lab and clinic, and 
						 extension training to build up well-rounded, well-trained students.</p>

					<h2>Single Mothers</h2>
					<p>Touch of Hope has initiated the Starfish Mothers program for single mothers to become entrepreneurs and 
					create a sustainable future for themselves and their family.</p>

						<p>One of unique aspects of this program is that it helps the women realize what true hope looks like 
						in their life and a lot of times leads to being able to have income for the first time.  In a lot of 
						cases, this program is crucial to keeping children with their mothers and out of an orphanage.</p>

					<h2>Agriculture</h2>
					<p>At UCI they do a female goat give away, educate on raising animals and simple economic program for 
					investing.  Water pumps are huge in irrigation of crops which 2/3 of the cost is paid back into the program
					 in 2 years.</p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#grade">More Info</button>
					<div id="grade" class="collapse">   
					<p>The pumps are used cooperatively with 5 farmers who all become educated, trained, and encouraged to 
					develop an economic plan for how the pump will affect the growing of their crops.  There is also a 
					reforestation plan by putting some of the cost of the tree back into buying more planting sacks.</p>
