        		<hr>
        		<p>Every short-term mission trip aims to
				accomplish UCI's three-fold mission experience in
				conjunction with the goals, talents, and
				abilities of the visiting team.  It is
				important to communicate with the Field
				Facilitators, either pre-field or early on-field,
				to determine what will be accomplished. Each team should
				be prepared to play a part in the ministry.  It is
				not just a “trip” or a “vacation”.  It is mission.
				</p>
				<h3>
				UCI Haiti's three-fold mission for short-term trips consists of:
				</h3>
				<ol>
					<li><span>Evangelism Ministry</span> – verbally
					communicating the Gospel of Jesus Christ
					using a variety of methods</li>
					<li><span>Construction Ministry</span> – contributing to the hands-on
					building, construction, and cleaning
					projects as needed</li>
					<li><span>Mercy (Service, Creative)
					Ministry</span>
					<ul>

					to those in need or hurting in orphanages,
					hospitals, prisons, and infirmaries</li>
						<li>providing helpful service to full-time

					pastors, educators, and officials</li>
					<li>allowing God to use the talents and
					imaginations of team members to share the
					Gospel in unique and creative ways (puppets,
					mimes, music, drama, sports, etc.)</li>

        		<h2 id="" class="inverted-box">How Much Does It Cost?<span type="button" class="btn btn-info faq-btn" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#cost">More Info</span></h2>
				<div id="cost" class="collapse text-left">
					<ol>
						<li><span>Team Fee of $45/day</span> - per diem for lodging, food, and local
						transportation around UCI. The team will have to include more funds for
						transportation costs  to and from the airport (see options below), due at
						least 2 weeks before your trip (the sooner the better so it can be
						deposited directly to Haiti before your team gets there)</li>
						<li><span>Vehicle surcharge of $50/person</span> - due when per diems are paid.  This
						is not to be confused with transportation costs as this surcharge helps us
						with the maintenance/repair of our vehicles</li>
						<li><span>Tourist Fee at the Port-au-Prince airport</span> - $10 US/person to be paid
						before entering the passport area.</li>
						<li><span>Airfare from US/Canada to Haiti:</span></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Group fares available through commercial airlines such as
								American Airlines (Port-au-Prince or Cap Haitian), Spirit, Delta,
								Air France, etc.  The trip from the Port airport to UCI is shorter
								than the trip from Cap Haitian to UCI.  Flights need to arrive into
								Port before 5 PM or we will ask that a guesthouse in Port be
								reserved for the team for the first night.  This is due to security
								factors.  It is not entirely safe to drive at night.</li>
								<li>MFI (Missionary Flights International — has to be reserved
								approximately 9-12 months in advance), also well worth extra money
								for the round trip to Pignon which is a few miles from UCI — or
								commercial airline plus.</li>
							</ul>
						<li><span>Transportation from airports to UCI:</span></li>
						 	<ul>
								<li>MAF (Mission Aviation Fellowship – gets you right into Pignon. 
								$320 for a 5-seater charter plane with very limited on amount of
								luggage — 25lbs/person  or $640 for a 10-seater charter (with basically
								unlimited luggage) Reservations can be made on MAF website.</li>
						 		<li>If you choose not to fly to UCI from Port Au Prince or Cap
						 		Hatian, you can choose one of these options:</li>
								<ul>
									<li>UCI bus: $400/one way trip</li>
									<li>Van that can hold 10-12 people and their luggage (if luggage
									is not excessive): $200/one-way trip</li>
									<li>Taptap pick-up: $150/one-way trip--useful for excess luggage</li>
									<li>UCI vehicles: $75/one-way trip--Hilux pick-up holds 5-6
									people inside, Land Cruiser holds 13 people inside.</li>
								</ul>
							</ul>
						<li><span>Out-of-pocket expenses</span> – you should plan for some souvenirs, offerings to
						national churches, some food or snacks on the way. Each team member is
						responsible for their own needs.</li>
						<li><span>Extra “Team Money”</span> - for special projects determined by each team (this
						could be for a special building project, craft items, Bibles, materials,
						etc.)</li>
					</ol>
					<h3>*All checks should be payable to United Christians International (UCI).</h3>
					<p>For
					donations to be tax-deductible, team members’ names should NOT be written
					anywhere on the check, including the memo line.  Instead, attach a note
					indicating what the donation is for—all unused portions of donations go to
					UCI-Haiti.</p>
					<h3>What does the Team Fee cover?</h3> 
					<ul>  
						<li>on-field accommodations and meals</li>
						<li>laundry (done by hand)</li>
						<li>safe drinking water and sodas</li>
						<li>local transportation around UCI, unless UCI vehicles cannot handle the size of your team</li>
						<li>pre-field training and materials (ask for via the UCI, Box 51 address)</li>
						<li>on-field leadership, translators</li>
						<li>guards on the UCI-Haiti compound</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Who makes the travel arrangements?</h3>
					<ul>  
						<li>UCI recommends the Team Leader arrange air travel.  Another possible
						resource would be www.wideworldtravel.com.  Others are available on the
						web.</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Important travel notes:</h3>
					<ul>  
						<li>When planning your air travel, remember all team members should arrive
						at the mission destination at the same time and depart at the same time.  
						Get UCI’s approval of your complete itinerary before actually purchasing
						tickets.</li>

						<h3>Additional Trip Tips</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Plan to leave as many of your renewable supplies as possible for
								use in UCI ministries or by the missionaries.  It is difficult and
								expensive to get many things we take for granted.</li>
								<li>Pack most small items (especially food) in sealable Ziplock bags.</li>
								<li>Keep all food items in sealed plastic (not glass) containers,
								Tupperware, or Rubbermaid–insect and rodent attractions.</li>
								<li>Airlines won’t allow sharp items in carry-ons or aerosol cans in regular luggage.</li>
								<li>Ladies, wear <b>minimal</b> makeup and jewelry. Less is better.  No hair blowdryers</li>
								<li>Modesty in dress is never offensive so consider others’ preferences before your own.</li>
								<li>Leave photocopy of passport at home.</li>
								<li>Dress up for Sunday church services: women wear dresses and skirts (no
								sleeveless for church, please), men wear button-down shirts and
								slacks - many wear ties.</li>
								<li>Unwrap any new items from its packaging as they are more likely to pass through customs.</li>
								<li>When filling out (on visa when going into the country) the
								reason for coming to this country, reply “visiting friends”.  And
								when visiting Haiti, put as address: UCI, Caiman area, Bohoc,
								Central Plateau, Pignon, Haiti.</li>
								<li>Take many small bills in to exchange–like $5's or $10's.</li>
								<li>Give the missionary family... FAMILY TIME!</li>
								<li>Have a “weigh-in party” the day/evening before to get weight
								distributed amongst team members, make sure there are no unplanned
								overweights, and to avoid hassles at airports.  It is advisable to
								have luggage with wheels so you can take care of your own and avoid
								hassles with luggage carriers and their tips.</li>
