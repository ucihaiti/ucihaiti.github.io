        		<p> United Christians International began in February 2005 with JeanJean and Kristie Mompremier's God-given desire
				to share JeanJean’s seminary training with the lay pastors of the
				area near Caiman (JeanJean’s home town). What began as a 3 month stay
				in the fall of 2005, has now grown into a nutrition center, health
				clinic, elementary school, university, seminary, and training center
				for medical and agricultural students.
				</p>  
				<p> 
				Today, UCI's vision for the future involves three primary objectives:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Teaching The Word Of God</li>
					<li>Equipping Future National Leaders Through Education & Training</li>
					<li>Uniting Christians Around The World</li>
				</ul>

								Kristie (DeBoer) Mompremier was born in Northwest Iowa (USA) 
								and became passionate about vocational missions after college. She joined ECHO
								(Educational Concerns for Hunger Organization), an agricultural mission 
								out of Fort Myers, FL which took her to the Central Plateau of Haiti.
								</p>
								<p>
								Jean Jean Mompremier was born in Caiman in the Central Plateau of
								Haiti, and eventually became a teacher at a Christian high school, an
								experience that would strengthen his love for, and
								trust in God.
								</p>		
								<p>
								Their love for Jesus and a strong desire to serve others brought them together in Haiti  
								where they married and now have two daughters, Rithana (Tana) and
								Kerlande (Kerri). After returning to the U.S. so Jean Jean could complete seminary
								and Kristie could become a nurse, they returned to Haiti with a vision to
								serve Jean Jean’s childhood community.
								</p>
								<p>
								What began as a 3 month stay in the fall of 2005, has now grown into 
								a nutrition center, health clinic, elementary school, university, seminary,
								and training center for medical and agricultural students. And UCI continues to grow, 
								meeting the needs of the community, while touching the lives of Haitians
								through sharing, studying, and living out the Gospel. From these small beginnings, the gospel 
						has turned a small village that was marked by vodou and hatred, into a community that works together.
						Today, UCI has over 600 elementary students
								and over 500 university students with the vision to train up Godly
								leaders that will revive their communities for Christ.

								<h2>Holy Spirit</h2>
								<p>
								We believe in the present ministry of
								the Holy Spirit who glorifies the Lord
								Jesus Christ and in this present age
								convicts people of sin, regenerates
								them, and then indwells, guides,
								instructs, and empowers the believer for
								godly living and service.
								</p>
								<h2>Scripture</h2>
								<p>
								We believe in the divine inspiration and
								inerrant authority of the Scriptures
								(both Old and New Testaments) as the
								only authoritative Word of God.
								</p>
								<h2>Human Being</h2>
								<p>
								We believe that human beings were
								created in the image of God, but fell
								into sin and are therefore lost and that
								only through regeneration by the Holy
								Spirit can sinful and lost people
								experience God’s salvation.
								</p>
								<h2>Trinity</h2>
								<p>
								We believe that there is one God,
								infinitely perfect and eternally
								existent in three persons: Father, Son,
								and Holy Spirit. 
								</p>
								<h2>Ordinances</h2>
								<p>
								We believe that the Lord’s supper and
								water baptism are ordinances to be
								observed by the church during the
								present age, but that they are not a
								means of salvation.
								</p>
								<h2>Church</h2>
								<p>
								We believe in one holy Christian church,
								the body of Christ which is comprised of
								all who have been regenerated by the
								Holy Spirit and experienced saving faith
								in Jesus Christ. Thus, there is a vital
								spiritual unity of all believers in our
								Lord Jesus Christ. We believe that Jesus
								Christ is the Lord and Head of the
								Church, and every local church has the
								right under Christ to decide and govern
								its own affairs.
								</p>
								<h2>Christ</h2>
								<p>
								We believe that Jesus Christ is true God
								and true man, having been conceived and
								born of the Virgin Mary. He died on the
								cross, a sacrifice for our sins,
								according to the Scriptures. He arose
								bodily from the dead, ascended into
								heaven, where at the right hand of the
								Majesty on High, He is now our High
								Priest and Advocate.
								</p>
								<h2>Salvation</h2>
								<p>
								We believe that faith in the blood shed
								of Jesus and His resurrection provide
								the only grounds for justification and
								becoming the children of God. It is only
								by the grace that comes through faith in
								Christ that salvation and spiritual life
								can be obtained.
								</p>
								<h2>Bodily Resurrection</h2>
								<p>
								We believe in the resurrection of both
								the saved and the lost. Those who are
								saved unto the resurrection of
								everlasting and blessed life and they
								that are lost unto the resurrection of
								everlasting, conscious punishment.
								</p>
								<h2>Return of Christ</h2>
								<p>
								We believe in the second coming of Jesus
								Christ which will bring about the
								consummation of all things and that this
								“blessed hope” has vital bearing on the
								personal life and service of the
								believer.

								Our volunteer Haitian board determines the main needs of the area and where to
								direct UCI’s resources. They determine the budget and project list as they are men and
								women nationals who know and care about their community's long-term needs. The U.S. board has
								been with UCI since its inception and are dedicated volunteer Christians from a variety
								of denominational backgrounds that desire to pray for UCI’s mission and
								help keep all things accountable to God. Their main objective is to support the Haitian
								board and ensure U.S. accountability. The U.S. and Haitian boards meet for an annual
								retreat, and the U.S. board members are committed to visiting UCI in Haiti once a
								year. UCI hopes to one day provide a way for more Haitian board members to visit the supporting
								churches in the United States.
