							Kristie (DeBoer) Mompremier was born in Northwest Iowa (USA) 
							and became passionate about vocational missions after college. She joined ECHO
							(Educational Concerns for Hunger Organization), an agricultural mission 
							out of Fort Myers, FL which took her to the Central Plateau of Haiti.
							<p>
							</p>
							Jean Jean Mompremier was born in Caiman in the Central Plateau of
							Haiti, and eventually became a teacher at a Christian high school, an
							experience that would strengthen his love for, and
							trust in God.
							<p>		
							</p>
							Their love for Jesus and a strong desire to serve others brought them together in Haiti  
							where they married and now have two daughters, Rithana (Tana) and
							Kerlande (Kerri). After returning to the U.S. so Jean Jean could complete seminary
							and Kristie could become a nurse, they returned to Haiti with a vision to
							serve Jean Jean’s childhood community.
							<p>
							</p>
							What began as a 3 month stay in the fall of 2005, has now grown into 
							a nutrition center, health clinic, elementary school, university, seminary,
							and training center for medical and agricultural students. And UCI continues to grow, 
							meeting the needs of the community, while touching the lives of Haitians
							through sharing, studying, and living out the Gospel. From these small beginnings, the gospel 
					has turned a small village that was predominantly vodou and changed it into a community that works together.
					Today, UCI has over 600 elementary students
							and over 500 university students with the vision to train up Godly
							leaders that will revive their communities for Christ.
