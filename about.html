				<h1> Jean-Jean and Kristie Mompremier</h1>
				<p>
				How did a farm girl from Orange City, Iowa and a Haitian boy from
				Caiman, Haiti meet? It can only be explained by the grace and planning
				of God.

				Kristie (DeBoer) Mompremier was born in Northwest Iowa (USA) to a family
				of 5 children . She was an avid sports player, graduated from
				Northwestern College with a degree in Biology and Math, and became
				passionate about an evangelical missionary vocation. She joined ECHO
				(Educational Concerns for Hunger Organization) in Fort Myers, FL as an
				intern. This agricultural mission worked in Haiti and that is what led
				her to the Central Plateau.

				Jean Jean Mompremier, born in the Caiman in the Central Plateau of
				Haiti, has overcome many difficulties that led him to become a teacher
				at a Christian high school. This strengthened his love, belief, and
				trust in God.

				Their story together began when God introduced them to each other in
				Haiti. What they did not know at the time was that God put a strong
				desire in their hearts to serve others. Jean Jean and Kristie married
				and God richly blessed them with two daughters, Rithana (Tana) and
				Kerlande (Kerri). They spent some time in the United States, Jean Jean
				became a minister, and they returned to Jean Jean’s childhood community
				in Haiti. They thought they would only be staying for 3 months because
				that is all the money they had, but God had other plans.

				UCI was born of faith in the fall of 2005. Kristie and Jean Jean
				returned to Haiti to start working to help all of God’s people. God
				calls them to be preachers and do-ers of the gospel and to spread the
				message of the Gospel of salvation. This led to church planting and
				evangelism to the people lost in vodou. Another need was felt when the
				lack of nutrition and health devastated many children in the community.
				This led to the opening of the first nutrition center . These opened the
				door to an ever-growing group seeking to learn more about Christ.
				Despite these very meager beginnings, UCI continues to grow, reaching
				out to the needs of the community, and touching the lives of Haitians
				with the good news of the Gospel in word and practice. Today, UCI has an
				elementary school with over 600 children and a university with over 500
				students. The goal for these 2 educational pursuits: train up Christian
				leaders that will impact and change their communities in Haiti for God.
