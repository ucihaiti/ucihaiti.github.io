										in their distress and to keep oneself from being
										polluted by the world.”
										James 1:27
									</p>
									<p>
									In order to meet this need in an efficient way, UCI created feeding centers where children and families are 
									able to come and receive 
					 				a meal during the week. Children
					 				who previously relied on eating the ashes from
					 				the fire to fill their stomachs are being
					 				provided a nutritional meal 3 to 4 times a
					 				week. These centers have also provided
					 				opportunities to teach the parents to plant 
					 				their own gardens and receive female goats in order to have an opportunity to make a financial investment.
					 				</p>
									<p>Merely handing out food has provided opportunities to share the gospel and to talk about how God’s word 
									is much greater than the basic necessities that we think that we need here on earth.</p>
									<p>
									By sponsoring a nutrition center you can provide food
									to children that would otherwise go hungry.
									</p>

										<li><span>Construction Ministry</span> – contributing to the hands-on
										building, construction, and cleaning
										projects as needed</li>
										<li><span>Mercy (Service, Creative)
										Ministry</span>
										<ul>
											<li>demonstrating God’s love

										hospitals, prisons, and infirmaries</li>
											<li>providing helpful service to full-time

										pastors, educators, and officials</li>

										Gospel in unique and creative ways (puppets,
