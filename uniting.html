        		<p>The impact of UCI has been immense since its inception. A community once overshadowed
				by Vodou and dominated by fear and hatred, is now a community working together as a 
				result of the Gospel. God has used UCI to empower Haitians and help 9 villages surrounding 
				Caiman with church planting, irrigation, agriculture, high quality
        		education, clean water, sanitation, feeding malnourished children, and constructing houses
        		for the people. UCI uniting is not only uniting Christians in Caiman, but throughout the world, 
        		through short-term missions and service projects.

								Kristie (DeBoer) Mompremier was born in Northwest Iowa (USA) 
								and became passionate about vocational missions after college. She joined ECHO
								(Educational Concerns for Hunger Organization), an agricultural mission 
								out of Fort Myers, FL which took her to the Central Plateau of Haiti.
								</p>
								<p>
								Jean Jean Mompremier was born in Caiman in the Central Plateau of
								Haiti, and eventually became a teacher at a Christian high school, an
								experience that would strengthen his love for, and
								trust in God.
								</p>		
								<p>
								Their love for Jesus and a strong desire to serve others brought them together in Haiti  
								where they married and now have two daughters, Rithana (Tana) and
								Kerlande (Kerri). After returning to the U.S. so Jean Jean could complete seminary
								and Kristie could become a nurse, they returned to Haiti with a vision to
								serve Jean Jean’s childhood community.
								</p>
								<p>
								What began as a 3 month stay in the fall of 2005, has now grown into 
								a nutrition center, health clinic, elementary school, university, seminary,
								and training center for medical and agricultural students. And UCI continues to grow, 
								meeting the needs of the community, while touching the lives of Haitians
								through sharing, studying, and living out the Gospel. From these small beginnings, the gospel 
						has turned a small village that was marked by vodou and hatred, into a community that works together.
						Today, UCI has over 600 elementary students
								and over 500 university students with the vision to train up Godly
								leaders that will revive their communities for Christ.

					<h2>Health</h2>
					<p>For those that come to the clinic in Caiman, there is a benevolent fund for the ones that are not able

					<h2>Short-Term Missions</h2>
					<p>At both UCI and Touch of Hope there is an elementary school which are host to 660 and over 1,000 
					students respectively.  Currently, about half of the children in Haiti do not have the opportunity to 
					complete a primary education.</p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#classroom">More</button>
					<div id="classroom" class="collapse">   
						<p> Touch of Hope believes every child in their community should be able to attend school and therefore
						 charges a nominal fee (if the parents can afford it).  Breakfast and lunch are provided daily and for 
						 some it may be the only meal they get that day.   At UCI, the parents are encouraged to work once a 
						 month at the school to help pay back and invest in their child’s education.  The University at UCI is 
						 host to one of the leading medical programs in the country along with seminary students, agriculture, 
						 business, etc.   On all levels of schooling there is a scholarship program that allows students the 
						 opportunity to go to school.</p>
						<p>All university scholarship recipients have work study, behavioral, and academic requirements.  There
						 is a science lab, computer lab, and internet in all the classrooms, dissection lab and clinic, and 
						 extension training to build up well-rounded, well-trained students.</p>

					<h2>Service-Projects</h2>
					<p>Touch of Hope has initiated the Starfish Mothers program for single mothers to become entrepreneurs and 
					create a sustainable future for themselves and their family.</p>
					<button type="button" class="btn btn-info" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#support">More</button>
					<div id="support" class="collapse">
						<p>One of unique aspects of this program is that it helps the women realize what true hope looks like 
						in their life and a lot of times leads to being able to have income for the first time.  In a lot of 
						cases, this program is crucial to keeping children with their mothers and out of an orphanage.</p>
