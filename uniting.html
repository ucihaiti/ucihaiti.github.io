        		and help 9 villages surrounding 
				Caiman with church planting, irrigation, agriculture, high quality
        		education, clean water, sanitation, feeding malnourished children, and constructing houses
        		for the people. UCI is not only uniting Christians in Caiman, but throughout the world, 
        		through short-term missions and service projects.

										faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows
										in their distress and to keep oneself from being
										polluted by the world.”
										James 1:27
									</p>
									<p>
									In order to meet this need in an efficient way, UCI created feeding centers where children and families are 
									able to come and receive 
					 				a meal during the week. These centers have also provided opportunities to teach the parents to plant 
					 				their own gardens and receive female goats in order to have an opportunity to make an economic investment.
					 				</p>
									<p>Merely handing out food has provided opportunities to share the gospel and to talk about how God’s word 
									is much greater than the basic necessities that we think that we need here on earth.</p>
									<p>
									By sponsoring a nutrition center you can provide food
									to children that would otherwise go hungry.
									</p>
