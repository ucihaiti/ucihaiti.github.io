									<p>“Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and
										faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows
										in their distress and to keep oneself from being
										polluted by the world.”
										James 1:27
									</p>
									<p>
									In order to meet this need in an efficient way, UCI created feeding centers where children and families are 
									able to come and receive 
					 				a meal during the week. Children
					 				who previously relied on eating the ashes from
					 				the fire to fill their stomachs are being
					 				provided a nutritional meal 3 to 4 times a
					 				week. These centers have also provided
					 				opportunities to teach the parents to plant 
					 				their own gardens and receive female goats in order to have an opportunity to make an economic investment.
					 				</p>
									<p>Merely handing out food has provided opportunities to share the gospel and to talk about how God’s word 
									is much greater than the basic necessities that we think that we need here on earth.</p>
									<p>
									By sponsoring a nutrition center you can provide food
									to children that would otherwise go hungry.
									</p>
									<ul>

										<li>The message of Christ is shared with children from the nutrition center</li>
